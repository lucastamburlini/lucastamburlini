## Hi there! 👋
I’m a Full Stack Developer and QA Automation Engineer, a Henry bootcamp graduate, and passionate about technology.
I also hold a degree in Human Capital Management from the University of Belgrano.
I started my career in Human Resources, but my passion for technology led me to transition into software development — a path I’ve been following for over three years, constantly learning and improving.
